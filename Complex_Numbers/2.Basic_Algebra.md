# Basic Agelbra


Complex numbers follow the same algebraic rules as real numbers. The most common method of solving algebraic equations is to separate out the real terms and imaginary terms and deal with them separately in the knowledge that no combination of real numbers can be equal to an imaginary number and vice versa. 

For example, this is done when solving the following equation: 
 
 <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle z + 6iz^* = 4 - 4iz"> 

z+%2B+6iz%5E%2A+%3D+4+-+4iz

$$[\O\H^{-}]=K_\W/[\H^{+}]$$

Step 1:
Express zz and z∗z∗ in the form x+iyx+iy (either the x+iyx+iy or a+bia+bi can used):
x+iy+6i(x−iy)=4−4ix+iy+6i(x−iy)=4−4i
x+iy+6ix+6y=4−4ix+iy+6ix+6y=4−4i
Step 2:
Equate the real parts and imaginary parts separately:
Real:
x+6y=4x+6y=4
Imaginary:
y+6x=−4y+6x=−4
Solve simultaneously:
 
x=4−6y⇒y+6(4−6y)=−4x=4−6y⇒y+6(4−6y)=−4
y−36y+24=−4y−36y+24=−4
−35y=−28−35y=−28
⇒y=45x=−45⇒y=45x=−45
⇒z=−45+45i
