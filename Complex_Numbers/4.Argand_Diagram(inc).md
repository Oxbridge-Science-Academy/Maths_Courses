# Argand Diagram

A common way of visualising complex numbers is on an Argand diagram. This a 2 dimensional graph where the vertical axis corresponds to the imaginary part of a complex number and the horizontal axis corresponds to the real part. 

The complex number is viewed as a vector with a length corresponding to its magnitude, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|z|">. To represent a complex number on the Argand diagram, we move along the real axis by the required amount and then along the imaginary axis. For example, the complex number <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1 %2B\ 2i "> is represented by moving along 1 on the real axis and up 2 on the imaginary axis. 

Several complex numbers are shown on the Argand diagram below.

# Magnitude and Length
Consideration of Pythagoras should convince you that for a number <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z= x %2B\ iy"> the length is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{[Re(z)]^2 %2B\ [Im(z)]^2} ">.   

### Argument 

When we represent number on the Argand diagram, it is obvious that the angle the vector makes with the positive real axis, called the argument and typically denoted by 𝜃, is determined by the relative sizes and signs of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number. When in the top right quadrant:           
 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta = \arctan(\frac{Im(z)}{Re(z)}) ">
 
This angle is called the argument of the complex number, denoted arg⁡(𝑧). In the case of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z=1 %2B\ 2i">, the argument is:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=arg(z) = \arctan(\frac{1}{2}) \approx 1.11 ">

It is acceptable to express the argument in radians or degrees but, as always, care should be taken with calculator settings and you should be consistent in your work. Generally, it is easier to work in radians.

It is important to note that if the complex is not in the top right quadrant, we cannot just use  𝜃=arctan⁡(𝐼𝑚/𝑅𝑒) to find the argument. Instead, it is better the calculate the angle in the relevant quadrant using trigonometry and then add on the relevant number of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{\pi}{2}"> radians. 

For example in the diagram below, the best method is to calculate the angle <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha = \arctan(\frac{Re(z)}{Im(z)}) "> and then add to it the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta = \frac{3 \pi}{2} ">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta = \frac{3 \pi}{2} + \alpha "> 

### Modulus-Argument Form

Considering complex numbers on the Argand plane allows us to represent them in a different form. This is called the modulus-argument form. 

Using trigonometry, the real and imaginary parts of a complex number can expressed in terms of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta">  and its length <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=R"> :

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Re(z) = R \cos \theta"> 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Im(z) = R \sin \theta"> 

Therefore, the complex number can be expressed as:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z = R (\cos \theta %2B\ i \sin \theta)"> 

For example, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z = 1 %2B\ i">: 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math= \theta = \arctan(\frac{1}{1}) = \frac{\pi}{4} ">  

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=R = \sqrt{2}  ">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z = \sqrt{2} ( \cos \frac{\pi}{4} %2B\ i\sin \frac{\pi}{4} ) ">

### Alternative Modulus - Argument Form

There is another way to express the modulus-argument form. The exponential function can be expressed in terms of sine and cosine. The derivation of this is beyond the scope of the course but for now we can write:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\cos \theta %2B\ i\sin \theta = e^{i \theta}  ">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Rightarrow R(\cos \theta %2B\ i\sin \theta) = Re^{i \theta}">

The <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Re^{i \theta}"> form is more concise and favoured when it comes to performing operations like differentiation and integration and multiplying/dividing complex numbers. This is particularly useful when we apply complex numbers to problems in the physical sciences (see later). 

The complex conjugate is also easy to express using this form. 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z = x %2B\ iy \Rightarrow z^* = x -iy ">

Reversing the sign of the imaginary part:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z^* = R(\cos \theta - i\sin \theta) ">

Note that:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\cos (-\theta) = \cos \theta "> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sin (-\theta) = \sin \theta ">



cos θ=cos(−θ)cos θ=cos(−θ) and sin θ=−sin(−θ)sin θ=−sin(−θ):
z∗=R(cos(−θ)+i sin(−θ))z∗=R(cos(−θ)+i sin(−θ))
=Re−iθ=Re−iθ
Thus we see that to express the complex conjugate of a complex number, we need only change the sign of the argument. On the complex plane, this corresponds to a reflection in the real axis as shown below by:
 z=1+i=2‾√eiπ4z=1+i=2eiπ4

and its complex conjugate:
 z∗=1−i=2‾√ei7π4=2‾√e−iπ4z∗=1−i=2ei7π4=2e−iπ4


This also highlights another important feature of the argument. Rotation in a clockwise direction from the real axis can be expressed by a negative angle. For example, z∗=1−iz∗=1−i makes an angle of π4π4 with the real axis as shown. Going clockwise requires a rotation of 7π47π4 radians so it could be expressed as 2‾√ei7π42ei7π4 but it is also acceptable to express it as 2‾√e−iπ42e−iπ4.The difference between the two possible arguments will always be 2π2π.


Conversion between forms
Converting the x+iyx+iy form to the ReiθReiθform has already been discussed. The modulus and argument should be calculated separately using R=|z|=x2+y2‾‾‾‾‾‾‾√=(Re(z))2+(Im(z))2‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾√R=|z|=x2+y2=(Re⁡(z))2+(Im⁡(z))2 for the modulus and careful consideration of trigonometry for the argument. 
 
To go the other way, Reiθ→x+iyReiθ→x+iy, it is best to perform the conversion Reiθ→R(cos θ+isin θ)Reiθ→R(cos θ+isin θ). Calculation of cos θcos θ and sin θsin θ then allows conversion to x+iyx+iy. 
For example, express 4eiπ64eiπ6in the form x+iy:
\(4e^{i \frac {\pi}{6}}=4 \left( cos \space \frac {\pi}{6}+ isin \space \frac {\pi}{6} \right)\)
\(=4 \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + i \frac{1}{2} \right)\)
\(=2\sqrt{3} + i \frac{1}{2}\)
 
### Visualising Operations

The \(Re^{i\theta}\) form makes it easier to understand the link between the Argand plane and the result of performing various operations on complex numbers. Consider two numbers \(z_1=R_1e^{i\theta_1}\) and \(z_2=R_2e^{i\theta_2}\)
Multiplication 
\(z_1z_2=R_1e^{i\theta_1}R_2e^{i\theta_2}\)
\(=R_1R_2e^{i(\theta_1+\theta_2)}\)
 
The result has magnitude \(R_1R_2\)and argument \(\theta_1+\theta_2\). This corresponds to a rotation about the origin in the Argand plane and a lengthening/shortening of the vector. 
Division 
\(\frac{z_1}{z_2}=\frac{R_1e^{i\theta_1}}{R_2e^{i\theta_2}}=\frac{R_1}{R_2}e^{i(\theta_1-\theta_2)}\)
The result has magnitude \(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\)and argument \(\theta_1-\theta_2\). Again, this involves a rotation and change in length. 
Raising to the power n:  
\(z^n=\left(Re^{i\theta} \right)^n =R^ne^{in\theta}\)
The result has magnitude \(R^n\)and the argument is now \(n\theta\); another rotation about the origin and change of length.
 
Consider squaring \(z=1+\sqrt{3}i\) :
\(z=1+\sqrt{3}i=2e^{i \frac{\pi}{3}}\)
\(z^2=\left( 2e^{i \frac{\pi}{3}} \right)^2=4e^{i \frac{2\pi}{3}}\)
\(=4 \left( cos \frac {2\pi}{3} +i \space sin \frac {2\pi}{3} \right)\)
\(=4 \left( - \frac {1}{2} +i \frac {\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)\)
\(=-2 +2i \sqrt{3} \)
 
The argument has doubled as expected (\(\theta \rightarrow 2\theta\)) which corresponds to a rotation anti-clockwise about the origin and, in this case, the magnitude has been squared.
