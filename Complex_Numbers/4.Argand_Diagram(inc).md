# Argand Diagram

A common way of visualising complex numbers is on an Argand diagram. This a 2 dimensional graph where the vertical axis corresponds to the imaginary part of a complex number and the horizontal axis corresponds to the real part. 

The complex number is viewed as a vector with a length corresponding to its magnitude, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|z| ">. To represent a complex number on the Argand diagram, we move along the real axis by the required amount and then along the imaginary axis. For example, the complex number <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math= 1 %2B\ 2i "> is represented by moving along 1 on the real axis and up 2 on the imaginary axis. 

Several complex numbers are shown on the Argand diagram below.

# Magnitude and Length
Consideration of Pythagoras should convince you that for a number <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z= x %2B\ iy"> the length is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{[Re(z)]^2 %2B\ [Im(z)]^2} ">.   

### Argument 

When we represent number on the Argand diagram, it is obvious that the angle the vector makes with the positive real axis, called the argument and typically denoted by 𝜃, is determined by the relative sizes and signs of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number. When in the top right quadrant:           
 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta = \arctan(\frac{Im(z)}{Re(z)}) ">
 
This angle is called the argument of the complex number, denoted arg⁡(𝑧). In the case of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z=1 %2B\ 2i">, the argument is:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=arg(z) = \arctan(\frac{1}{2}) \approx 1.11 ">

It is acceptable to express the argument in radians or degrees but, as always, care should be taken with calculator settings and you should be consistent in your work. Generally, it is easier to work in radians.

It is important to note that if the complex is not in the top right quadrant, we cannot just use  𝜃=arctan⁡(𝐼𝑚/𝑅𝑒) to find the argument. Instead, it is better the calculate the angle in the relevant quadrant using trigonometry and then add on the relevant number of 𝜋/2 radians. 

For example in the diagram below, the best method is to calculate the angle <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha = \arctan(\frac{Re(z)}{Im(z)}) "> and then add to it the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta = \frac{3 \pi}{2} ">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta = \frac{3 \pi}{2} + \alpha "> 

### Modulus-Argument Form

Considering complex numbers on the Argand plane allows us to represent them in a different form. This is called the modulus-argument form. 

Using trigonometry, the real and imaginary parts of a complex number can expressed in terms of 𝜃 and its length 𝑅:
𝑅𝑒𝑎𝑙=𝑥=𝑅 cos⁡𝜃	 𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑟𝑦=𝑦=𝑅 sin⁡𝜃

Therefore, the complex number can be expressed as:
 𝑧=𝑅 cos⁡𝜃+𝑖𝑅 sin⁡𝜃=𝑅(cos⁡𝜃+𝑖 sin⁡𝜃) 
For example, 𝑧=1+𝑖: 
𝜃=arctan⁡〖(1/1)=𝜋/4〗  and 𝑅=√(1^2+1^2 )=√2⟹𝑧=√2 (cos⁡〖𝜋/4〗+𝑖 sin⁡〖𝜋/4〗 )
