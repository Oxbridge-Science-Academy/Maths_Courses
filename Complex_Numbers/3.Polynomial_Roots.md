# Complex Roots

Consider again the equations <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x^2=4, x^2=-4">.

Both have two solutions or roots:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x^2=4 \Rightarrow x = \pm 2 ">

For the second equation, we make use of the fact that <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{a} \sqrt{b}">.


<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x^2=-4 \Rightarrow x = \sqrt{4} \sqrt{-1} = \pm 2i ">.


Trivially, these are polynomials of degree 2 (quadratics).
We can generalise to a polynomial of degree n. A polynomial of degree n, has n roots which can be either real or complex. 

### Quadratics
The 2 roots of a quadratic equation <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x^2 %2B\ bx %2B\ c = 0">
will either be both real or both complex. The roots will be complex roots when the discriminant, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sqrt(b^2-4ac) < 0 ">. 

Note that a repeated root, which occurs when <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sqrt(b^2-4ac) =0">, is still real. 

If the coefficients of a quadratic (a, b, c) are themselves real but the roots of polynomial are complex, the roots will be complex conjugates. In other words, if <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z= a %2B\ bi "> is one root of a quadratic, the other root will be  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z^*= a - bi ">

The Quadratic Formula
Unless a quadratic factorises readily, the easiest quickest way to find the complex roots of quadratic equations is to use the well-known formula.
For example: 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle x^2 %2B\ 6x %2B\10 =0 ">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x=\displaystyle \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{36-80}}{4} ">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{-64}}{4} ">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \frac{-6 \pm 8i}{4} ">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \Rightarrow x= \frac{-3}{2} \pm 2i ">


### Cubics
Cubic equations can either have 3 real roots (repeated or not) or 1 real and 2 complex roots. It is not possible to have 2 real and one complex root. This can be rationalised by considering the general shape of a cubic and the number of times it can cross a horizontal line such as the x axis.

### Higher Order Polynomials
The use of algebraic long division can be useful when finding the roots of higher order polynomials.
For example:

z+1 is a root of the cubic equation<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle z^2 - 2z^2 %2B\ 2z %2B\ 5 =0 ">: find the other two roots
 
Since z+1 is a root, when the polynomial is divided by z+1, we will get a quadratic with no remainder from which we can find the other two roots.

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \frac{z^2 - 2z^2 %2B\ 2z %2B\ 5}{z+1} = z^2 -3z %2B\5 ">

Using the quadratic formula, we arrive at as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle z = \frac{3}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{11}}{2}i "> the other two roots.
