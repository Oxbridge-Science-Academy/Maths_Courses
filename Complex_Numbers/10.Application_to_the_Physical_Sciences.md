# Application to the Physical Sciences 

Many problems in the Physical Science involve oscillating systems; ones that can be described by sine and/or cosine functions. These include 
- simple harmonic motion, 
- waves in one or more dimensions (e.g. electromagnetic waves), 
- alternating current and voltage in electrical circuits and the response of components such as capacitors. 

The key link to complex numbers is the ability to write the sine and cosine functions which describe the system in the exponential form:

Writing two trigonometric terms as one exponential makes mathematical expressions more concise and operations such as differentiation and integration easier.

Consider a mass, 𝑚, oscillating on a spring of negligible mass with spring constant 𝑘. We can write an equation to describe this system by acknowledging that the resultant force on the mass, 𝐹 (directly proportional to displacement from equilibrium 𝑧) is the restoring force exerted by the spring and equating this to the product of mass and acceleration, 𝑎:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=F = -kz = ma ">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Rightarrow ma %2B\ kz = 0 ">

Noting that acceleration is second derivative of displacement with respect to time:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a = \frac{d^2z}{dt^2}">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \Rightarrow m\frac{d^2}{dt^2} %2B\ kz = 0 ">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \Rightarrow \frac{d^2z}{dt^2} %2B\ \frac{k}{m}z = 0 ">

The solution to this second order differential equation (see Differential Equation course) is:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle z = A \cos \omega t %2B\ B \sin \omega t">

Where the angular frequency of oscillation <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle  \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}}">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle t"> is time and 𝐴 and 𝐵 are constants


Compare this to the trigonometric form of a complex number of magnitude 𝑅 and argument 𝜔𝑡: 
𝑅𝑒^𝑖𝜔𝑡=𝑅 cos⁡𝜔𝑡+𝑅𝑖 sin⁡𝜔𝑡 
We can write 𝑧=ℜ[𝑅𝑒^𝑖𝜔𝑡] where ℜ indicates that we are taking just the real part of the complex number. Finally, we need to express 𝑅 in terms of 𝐴 and 𝐵.
Let 𝑅=𝐴−𝑖𝐵⟹𝑅𝑒^𝑖𝜔𝑡=(𝐴−𝑖𝐵) 𝑒^𝑖𝜔𝑡=(𝐴−𝑖𝐵)  (cos⁡𝜔𝑡+𝑖 sin⁡𝜔𝑡)" "
=𝐴 cos⁡𝜔𝑡+𝐴𝑖 sin⁡𝜔𝑡−𝑖𝐵 cos⁡𝜔𝑡−𝑖^2 𝐵 sin⁡𝜔𝑡=(𝐴 cos⁡𝜔𝑡+𝐵 sin⁡𝜔𝑡 )+i(𝐴 sin⁡𝜔𝑡−𝐵 cos⁡𝜔𝑡)
Therefore, if 𝑅=𝐴−𝑖𝐵, the real part of the complex number is equal to the desired trigonometric expression. 𝑅 is the complex amplitude with the amplitude of oscillation equal to |𝑅|=√(𝐴^2+𝐵^2 )


𝑧=ℜ[𝑅𝑒^𝑖𝜔𝑡] delivers the same results as the trigonometric equation. 
For example, in SHM the acceleration 𝑎=−𝜔^2 𝑧. 
𝑎=(𝑑^2 𝑥)/(𝑑𝑡^2 )=𝑑^2/(𝑑𝑡^2 ) (ℜ[𝑅𝑒^𝑖𝜔𝑡])=𝑑/𝑑𝑡 (ℜ[𝑖𝜔𝑅𝑒^𝑖𝜔𝑡])

=ℜ[𝑖^2 𝜔^2 𝑅𝑒^𝑖𝜔𝑡 ]=ℜ[−𝜔^2 𝑅𝑒^𝑖𝜔𝑡 ]

=−𝜔^2 ℜ[𝑅𝑒^𝑖𝜔𝑡]=−𝜔^2 𝑧
We can even omit the ℜ notation during any mathematical operations and simply add it at the end, making the working even more concise. 

### Worked Example

The position of a particle undergoing SHM with frequency 𝜔=4 is:
𝑥=21 cos⁡4𝑡+6 sin⁡4𝑡. 
The first challenge is to express the displacement of the particle from the centre of motion, in exponential form. 

Using the reasoning from the previous example, the displacement will be the real part of a complex term	 𝑅𝑒^4𝑖𝑡 ⟹𝑥=ℜ[𝑅𝑒^4𝑖𝑡]

Comparing the expression 21 cos⁡𝜔𝑡+6 sin⁡𝜔𝑡 with the general expression from the previous example 𝐴 cos⁡𝜔𝑡+𝐵 sin⁡𝜔𝑡, we can see that the complex amplitude 𝑅=𝐴−𝑖𝐵=21−6𝑖. 

𝑥=ℜ[(21−6𝑖〖)𝑒〗^4𝑖𝑡]



Having established a complex expression for the displacement, it is worth considering how we can perform calculations regarding the system. 
Amplitude of oscillation: |𝑒^4𝑖𝑡 |=1 so we only need consider the (21−6𝑖) term. |(21−6𝑖)|=√(21^2+6^2 )=√477≈21.84

Time when the displacement is zero: 𝑥=ℜ[(21−6𝑖〖)𝑒〗^4𝑖𝑡 ]=0
21−6𝑖=√477 𝑒^(−𝑖 arctan⁡(6⁄21) )
⟹ℜ[√477 𝑒^(−𝑖 arctan⁡(6⁄21) ) 𝑒^4𝑖𝑡 ]=ℜ[√477 𝑒^𝑖(4𝑡−arctan⁡(6⁄21) )  ]
⟹√477  cos⁡(4𝑡−arctan⁡(6⁄21) )=0
⟹4𝑡−arctan⁡(6⁄21)=𝜋/2, 3𝜋/2, 5𝜋/2…(2𝑛+1)𝜋/2       𝐹𝑜𝑟 𝑛=0,1,2…
⟹𝑡=(2𝑛+1)𝜋/8+arctan⁡(6⁄21)/4=0.462, 1.248, 2.033
