# Introduction

Complex numbers are centred around the properties of the number <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle i=\sqrt{-1} ">.

Without complex numbers, equations such as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle x^2 = -4 "> would appear to have no solutions. After all, any number multiplied by itself must be positive since the product of two positives or the product of two negatives is positive. However, it turns out that we should be saying that <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle x^2 = -4 "> has no real solutions, in other words, no real number can satisfy it. Real numbers are a type of number in mathematics with particular properties but for now it suffices to say that a real number is any number which does not contain the square root of a negative number. <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle 4 "> is real while <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle 4i "> is not. 
 
### Expressing Complex Numbers 

Complex numbers, typically denoted z, contain a real term, a, and an imaginary term, b, allowing us to express them as:
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle z=a %2B\ bi">.

You will also see complex numbers written in terms of x & y  where x is the real term and y the imaginery term:
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle z=x %2B\ iy">.

It is important to note that a, b, x & y are all real numbers. Note that the imaginary part is multiplied by i.

For example, one complex number expressed in this form is:
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle z = 4 - 3i">.

The real part of z is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle Re(z) = 4">. and the imaginary part, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle Im(z) = -3">.
 
### Complex Conjugates

For reasons that will become evident later, it is often important to consider a complex number's complex conjugate. Every complex number has a complex conjugate, denoted <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle z^*">, which can be found quite simply by changing the sign of the imaginary part of the complex number while the real part is unchanged:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle z=a %2B\ bi \Rightarrow z^* = a - bi">

For example:
i. <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle z = 4 - 3i \Rightarrow z^* = 3 %2B\ bi">

ii. <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle z = i \Rightarrow z^* = -i">


iii. <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle z = 2 \Rightarrow z^* = 2 ">
The complex conjugate of a real number is itself.
 
**Multiplying a complex number by its complex conjugate yields a real number:**

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle zz* = (a %2B\bi)(a - bi) = a^2 - abi %2B\abi -b^2i^2">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle = a^2 %2B\b^2">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle = [Re(z)]^2 %2B\[Im(z)]^2">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle = |z|^2">


<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle = |z|^2">
 is the magnitude of the complex number. This will make more sense when we consider complex numbers as vectors shortly and see that the magnitude corresponds to the vector's length. 

### Manipulation of complex numbers - rationalising
The topic of complex numbers bear some resemblance to the topic of surds where it is common to express a term as the sum of a non-surd and a surd:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle a %2B\b \sqrt{c}">

Where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \sqrt{c}"> is irrational.

When a surd is found in the denominator of a fraction, rationalisation needs to be performed. An example of this is shown below: 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \frac{1}{a %2B\b \sqrt{c}} \times \frac{a - b \sqrt{c}} {a - b \sqrt{c}} = \frac{a - b \sqrt{c}} {a^2 - b^2c}">

Note that the relationship between <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle a %2B\b \sqrt{c}"> and  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle a - b \sqrt{c}">
 is similar in form to the relationship between a complex number <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle a %2B\bi"> and its complex conjugate <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle a - bi">; we are merely swapping <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \sqrt{c}"> for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle i">.


Quotients containing complex numbers can be rationalised in an analogous manner. For example: 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \frac{2 %2B\ 5i}{3 - 2i} = \frac{2 %2B\ 5i}{3 - 2i} \times \frac{3 %2B\ 2i}{3 %2B\ 2i}">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle = \frac{6 %2B\ 19i -10} {9 %2B\ 4}">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle = \frac{-4 %2B\ 19i} {13}">
