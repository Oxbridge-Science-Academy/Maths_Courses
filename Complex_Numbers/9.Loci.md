# Loci
 
Loci are regions on the complex plane. The most common are circles, lines and combinations of the two creating bounded regions. 
 
## Circles 
A circle with centre <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a%2B\bi "> and radius <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=c"> can be expressed as:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|z-(a%2B\bi)|=c">

One way to think about this is “the distance between an arbitrary point <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z"> and the fixed point <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a%2B\bi "> is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=c">. 

In other words, the equation <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|z-(a%2B\bi)|=c ">  is satisfied by all points a fixed distance from a particular point; these points <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z"> define the edge of a circle. 
 
Other loci are possible with circles. If we wanted to describe all points within a certain distance from a fixed point, we could write <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|z-(a%2B\bi)| \leq c ">.

## Lines 

We can define a line in terms of the two numbers or points which are equidistant from it. For example, the numbers <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z_1=i "> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z_2=2+i"> are equidistant from a line with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Re(z)=1 "> (the real component is equal to 1 – this is often stated as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x=1">). Any point on the line <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z "> therefore satisfies the equation:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|z-i|=|z-2-i|">

In another example, the expression <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|z-i|=|z %2B\3 %2B\ i|">
defines a line equidistant from the points <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=i">
 and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=-3i">, therefore satisfying <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Im(z)=-1"> or <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y=-1">.

## Regions

Just as with the circles, we can define regions bounded, partially or fully, by lines. 
Consider a slight modification to the first equation displayed above:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|z-i| < |z-2-i|">


This expression is satisfied by any point <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z"> which is closer to the point <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=i">
 than the point <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2 %2B\ i">. This therefore defines the region to the left of the line as shown.

## Determining cartesian equation of a line

Determining the equation of the line is straightforward when it is completely vertical or horizontal. However, it is possible to define loci with lines at an angle too. 
For example, a line equidistant from the points <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2i"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=-3 %2B\ i"> can be expressed as:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|z−2i|=|z− 3 %2B\ +i|">

To find the equation of this line write we make use of the fact that: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z = x %2B\ iy">


<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|x %2B\ iy - 2i)| = |x %2B\ iy %2B\ 3 - i| "> 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Rightarrow |x %2B\ i(y - 2))| = |(x %2B\ 3) %2B\ i(y - 1)| "> 


Noting that:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|x %2B\ iy| = \sqrt{x^2 %2B\ y^2}  "> 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|x %2B\ i(y-2)| = \sqrt{x^2 %2B\ (y-2)^2}  "> 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|(x+3) %2B\ i(y-1)| = \sqrt{(x+3)^2 %2B\ (y-2)^1}  "> 
Equating the two terms on the right side and squaring both to remove the square root: 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x^2 %2B\ (y-2)^2 = (x %2B\ 3)^2 + (y-1)^2"> 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x^2 %2B\ y^2 -4y %2B\ 4 = x^2 %2B\ 6x %2B 9 %2B y^2 -2y %2B +1 "> 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Rightarrow y = -3x -3 "> 


## Half lines

Unlike lines, half lines are bounded at one end, in other words they have a start point. Half lines are defined in term of their angle relative to the real axis, i.e. the argument of a complex number.

A half line starting at point <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a %2B\ i|">
with an argument <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta"> can be defined as: 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle arg(z - a - bi) = \theta">

For example, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=arg(z - 1 - i) = \frac{ \pi}{4}">
defines a half line originating at the point <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1 + i "> with an argument of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{\pi}{4}"> radians. It is necessary to indicate the direction with the arrow pointing away from the start point.

We can introduce inequalities to define regions as with full lines. For example <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=arg(z - 1 - i) < \frac{ \pi}{4}"> defines the region below the line shown, i.e. a region where the argument of a line starting at <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1  %2B\ i"> to a point <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z"> is less than <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{ \pi}{4}">.
