### Further substitution

If an integrand contains a linear function all raised to another power, for example:

there are two approaches. 

1. Consider what function would differentiate to give the integrand.

2. Use substitution by carefully choosing what to substitute.

The first method is not particularly tricky but often requires juggling expressions mentally and can lead to mistakes, particularly when trying to keep track of minus signs etc.

The second method may take longer but is less likely to cause issues. Generally the approach will be to substitute the linear term for a single parameter (e.g. ùë¢=3ùë•‚àí8) because the resulting the derivative produced when we change the variable of integration will be a constant which will not affect the difficulty of integration.
