## Symmetry 

When evaluating certain integrals, the symmetry of the integrand in the context of the limits of the integral can allow us immediately to spot that the result is zero. This is enormously useful as a time-saving measure. First we must consider the idea of symmetry and even and odd functions.

You may have come across the idea of even and odd functions before. If not the concept is straightforward. 

𝑓(𝑥)=𝑓(−𝑥)⟹ even 

𝑓(𝑥)=−𝑓(−𝑥)⟹ odd

Many functions are neither odd nor even, for example <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=e^x"> or <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\ln x ">.

Even functions include<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x^2, x^4, \cos x, \cos^2 x, \sin^2x ">. Odd functions include<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x, x^3, \sin x">.

### Odd functions
Consideration of the integrand’s symmetry can be applied when the integrand shows a line of symmetry in the middle of the integration limits. For example, consider:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sin x dx ">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \sin x "> has a line of symmetry at 𝑥=0, in the middle of the integration limits. 

The area where 𝑥<0 will precisely cancel out with the area where 𝑥>0 and so the integral will be zero. If we extended the limits equally in both direction, e.g. −2𝜋 to 2𝜋 or −∞ to ∞, the same treatment could be applied.

However, we could not apply the same treatment to: 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sin (x-0.3) dx "> 

as the integrand does not have a line of symmetry at 𝑥=0 (it has one at 𝑥=0.3). 

This is evident when the two functions are plotted:

### Even functions
The situation is different with even functions. We cannot immediately say that an integral is zero as we can with odd functions but we can simplify the integration of even functions by employing symmetry. 

From the plot below, it is evident that the areas either side of 𝑥=0 are equal so the integral over the whole area can be expressed in terms of the integral of half the area: 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos x dx = 2\int_{0}^{\pi/2} \cos x dx = 2[\sin x]_0^{\pi /2} = 2">

### Relevance to Physical Sciences

Determining if an integral is zero without having to evaluate it using the methods already discussed in this course is very useful.  In quantum mechanics, we often need to integrate a function over all space in one or more dimensions. An example of this is discussed below. 

A chemical bond can be thought of as a spring which oscillates. The oscillation, to a first approximation, is that of simple harmonic motion and we can describe this system using a quantum harmonic oscillator. For those of you who have studied Chemistry at A Level or equivalent, you may have encountered infra-red spectroscopy as a means of determining the functional groups within a molecule. Molecules are irradiated with infra-red radiation and certain bonds will absorb particular frequencies of radiation, causing a transition from a lower vibrational state to a higher vibrational state. This can be thought of as making the bond oscillate more rapidly. Each vibrational level can be described by a wavefunction whose mathematical form is determined by the system, just as each atomic orbital is a wavefunction (see atomic orbitals course). 

Ground state wavefunction <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \psi_0 = N_0 e^{-\alpha x^2}"> 

First excited state <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \psi_1 = N_1 x e^{-\alpha x^2}">  

where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle N_0, N_1, \alpha "> are constants 

The wavefunctions of the harmonic oscillator must be orthogonal (see QM course) which means:

 <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \int_{- \infinity}^{\infinity} \psi_0^* \psi_1 dx =0 "> 

Where * indicates the complex conjugate - see complex numbers course. In this case all functions are real so the complex conjugate is irrelevant.

We can test to see if the stated wavefunctions satisfy this criterion. 


<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \int_{- \infinity}^{\infinity} \psi_0^* \psi_1 dx =  \int_{- \infinity}^{\infinity} N_0 e^{-\alpha x^2} N_1 x e^{-\alpha x^2} dx = N_0 N_1 \int_{- \infinity}^{\infinity}  x e^{-2 \alpha x^2} dx "> 


It should be clear that  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle f(x) = N_0 N_1 \int_{- \infinity}^{\infinity} x e^{-2 \alpha x^2} dx "> is odd since the term in <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle x^2"> is even and the term in <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle x"> is odd. 

Therefore we know:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle N_0 N_1 \int_{- \infinity}^{\infinity}  x e^{-2 \alpha x^2} dx = 0 "> 


The orthogonality criterion is satisfied. Had we not used symmetry, the integral could have been evaluated using the substitution <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle u=2 \alpha x^2 "> since it is of the form “function and its derivative”.
