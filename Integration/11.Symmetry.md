## Symmetry 

When evaluating certain integrals, the symmetry of the integrand in the context of the limits of the integral can allow us immediately to spot that the result is zero. This is enormously useful as a time-saving measure. First we must consider the idea of symmetry and even and odd functions.

You may have come across the idea of even and odd functions before. If not the concept is straightforward. 

𝑓(𝑥)=𝑓(−𝑥)⟹ even 

𝑓(𝑥)=−𝑓(−𝑥)⟹ odd

Many functions are neither odd nor even, for example <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=e^x"> or <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\ln x ">.

Even functions include<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x^2, x^4, \cos x, \cos^2 x, \sin^2x ">. Odd functions include<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x, x^3, \sin x">.

Consideration of the integrand’s symmetry can be applied when the integrand shows a line of symmetry in the middle of the integration limits. For example, consider:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sin x dx ">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \sin x "> has a line of symmetry at 𝑥=0, in the middle of the integration limits. 

The area where 𝑥<0 will precisely cancel out with the area where 𝑥>0 and so the integral will be zero. If we extended the limits equally in both direction, e.g. −2𝜋 to 2𝜋 or −∞ to ∞, the same treatment could be applied.

However, we could not apply the same treatment to: 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sin (x-0.3) dx "> 

as the integrand does not have a line of symmetry at 𝑥=0 (it has one at 𝑥=0.3). 

This is evident when the two functions are plotted:
