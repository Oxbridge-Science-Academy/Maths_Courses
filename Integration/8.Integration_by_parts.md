## Integration by parts

However, choosing <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=u"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=v'"> based solely on what will disappear upon differentiation is not always the best option. Another thing we must consider is “can we easily integrate whatever we assign to be <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=v'">?”

Consider the integral:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\int x \ln x dx ">

At first glance it might appear sensible to assign <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=u=x">as it will disappear on differentiation. However, the integration of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\ln x"> is not straightforward (in fact it is best down by parts itself, see exercises) so it would not be sensible to make <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=v'=\ln x">
