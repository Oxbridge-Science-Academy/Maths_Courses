# Maths Courses

Welcome to the Mathematics section.

Each section corresponds to a topic taught in the first year Natural Sciences Maths A course but will be applicable to students doing Maths B as well. Each course has material and questions and the integration course also has answers. If you spot any errors with the content, questions or answers please do not edit the files directly, just drop us an email at jmw240@cam.ac.uk. We are also keen to improve the learning experience so are always happy to have your feedback (please use same email).

We hope you find the material helpful.

James and Adam
